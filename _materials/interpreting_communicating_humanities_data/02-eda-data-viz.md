In our last lesson, we tried to answer the following questions:

1. What is the average number of visits for each state?
2. What is the average number of visits for each National Park?
3. How many National Parks are there in each state?

Here's my solutions to these questions:

```python
# 1. What is the average number of visits for each state?
parks_data_df.groupby(['state'])['recreation_visits'].mean().reset_index()
# 2. What is the average number of visits for each National Park?
parks_data_df.groupby(['park_name'])['recreation_visits'].mean().reset_index()
# 3. How many National Parks are there in each state?
parks_data_df.groupby(['state'])['park_name'].nunique().reset_index()
```

We could store each of these in new variables but we also want to visualize this data to help us better understand it. That's what we'll be exploring further in this next lesson.

Rather than working with just the National Parks Data, we can also start to explore the remainder of the datasets from the *Responsible Datasets in Context Project*. For example, let's take a look at the "Top 500 Greatest Novels" dataset by Anna Preus and Aashna Sheth [https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/posts/top-500-novels/top-500-novels.html](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/posts/top-500-novels/top-500-novels.html).

First we need to create a new Jupyter notebook in our `pandas-eda` folder called `Top500NovelsEDA.ipynb` and then load in the data. How can we **read** data in Pandas?

While this cat is adorable, we can also use the `pd.read_csv()` method to read in our data.

```python
import pandas as pd

novels_df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/responsible-datasets-in-context/main/datasets/top-500-novels/library_top_500.csv")
```

Now we can start to explore this dataset. What methods could we use to get a sense of the data?

There's many answers to this question, but say we use `.info()`. We would see the following output:

```bash

```

This overview is telling us that we have far more columns in this datasets, each column's name and data type, and specifically the number of **non-null values** in each column.

## Missing Data in Pandas

In the last lesson, we covered how we could add null values to a DataFrame, but now we want to explore how we can work with them. Pandas has a lot of documentation for handling **missing data** that you can read here [https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/missing_data.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/missing_data.html). For our purposes, we're mostly concerned with the `isna()` and `notna()` methods.

While most of the columns have 500 non-null values, we can see that some of the columns have missing values. For example, `author_field_of_activity` has 329 non-null values, which means that there are 171 missing values. We can start to get a sense of what that column contains if we return to the dataset documentation, specifically the section "What's in the Data" [https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/posts/top-500-novels/top-500-novels.html?tab=data-essay#whats-in-the-data(https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/posts/top-500-novels/top-500-novels.html?tab=data-essay#whats-in-the-data)]. From there we can learn the following about this column:

> AUTHOR_FIELD_OF_ACTIVITY: Authorâ€™s primary fields of activity, according to VIAF. VIAF includes data from multiple global partner institutions, but we only collect VIAF data associated with the Library of Congress (LOC).

<figure>
	<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/VIAF_Screenshot_2012.png">
		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/VIAF_Screenshot_2012.png" alt="VIAF" class="image-popup">
	</a>
</figure>

For those unfamiliar, VIAF stands for the Virtual International Authority File, which is a service that provides a way to link and share information about authors and their works across different libraries and institutions. The idea for VIAF originated in 1998 as an experiment in trying to link authority records. As a reminder, authority records are standardized records that provide information about a specific entity, such as an author or a work, like MARC records. VIAF was officially launched in 2003 and is operated by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) in partnership with various national libraries and institutions.

<figure>
	<a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71J3wIQ6rRL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg">
		<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71J3wIQ6rRL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg" alt="VIAF" class="image-popup">
	</a>
</figure>

The impetus for the creation of VIAF was not just sharing information, but what LIS scholar Christine L. Borgman calls the "scaling problem in name disambiguation" in her book *Big Data, Little Data, No Data: Scholarship in the Networked World*. We've already talked about this briefly in discussing the challenges of "cleaning data", but the rise of multiple digital libraries and archives has made it increasingly difficult to accurately identify and attribute works to their correct authors, which is where projects like VIAF come in. However, as we discussed in class, there are still challenges with this system. For example, authors are not the ones who enter data into VIAF. Instead, it is often librarians or archivists who are responsible for creating and maintaining these records. This means that there can be discrepancies in how authors are represented, and it can be difficult to ensure that all works by a particular author are accurately attributed to them.

Now knowing this background, we can start to explore which authors have missing values in this column. We can do this by using the `isna()` method to check for missing values in the `author_field_of_activity` column.

```python
novels_df[novels_df['author_field_of_activity'].isna()]
```

Here we are using the `isna()` method to **filter** our DataFrame to only show rows where the `author_field_of_activity` column is null. If we wanted to see only rows where the column is not null, we could use the `notna()` method instead.

```python
novels_df[novels_df['author_field_of_activity'].notna()]
```

This will give us a DataFrame with all the authors who have a field of activity listed. We could also use the `~` operator to negate the boolean values returned by `isna()`.

```python
novels_df[~novels_df['author_field_of_activity'].isna()]
```

We haven't seen the `~` operator before, but it is a common way to negate boolean values in Python. So for example, if we had a boolean variable `x` that was `True`, then `~x` would be `False`. In addition, Pandas also has `isnull()` and `notnull()` methods that can be used interchangeably with `isna()` and `notna()`.

Finally, if we wanted to get rid of all rows in the `novels_df` DataFrame that have missing values in the `author_field_of_activity` column, we could either use our filtering logic to assign the result to a new variable or we could use the `dropna()` method.

```python
novels_df_cleaned = novels_df.dropna(subset=['author_field_of_activity'])
```

`dropna()` is a powerful method that can be used to remove missing values from a DataFrame. The `subset` parameter allows us to specify which columns we want to check for missing values. If we don't specify a subset, `dropna()` will remove any row that has a missing value in any column.

Here's a quick overview of the most common methods for handling missing values in Pandas:

| Pandas Method for Missing Values | Description | Usage |
|----------------------------------|-------------|-----|
| `isna()`                         | Returns a boolean DataFrame indicating whether each value is missing (NaN) | Can be used to filter DataFrames, Series, GroupBy objects, etc. or to identify the amount of missing data (`df.isna().sum()`) |
| `notna()`                        | Returns a boolean DataFrame indicating whether each value is not missing | Used similar to `isna()` |
| `isnull()`                      | Alias for `isna()` | Used interchangeably with `isna()` |
| `notnull()`                     | Alias for `notna()` | Used interchangeably with `notna()` |
| `dropna()`                      | Removes missing values from a DataFrame or Series | Can be used to drop rows or columns with missing values |
| `fillna()`                      | Fills missing values with a specified value or method | Can be used to replace NaN values with a specific value or interpolate missing values |

Knowing how to work with missing data is important since we often have gaps when working with cultural datasets. Furthermore, it's important to know that certain methods like `groupby()` will automatically ignore missing values, so we should always check the distribution of our data before we start analyzing it.

## Merging Data With Pandas

Now that we are understanding how to work with missing data, we can also start to explore how to augment our dataset in various ways. One of the most common ways to do this is through **merging** datasets together.

We've already seen one approach `pd.concat()` that allows us to concatenate DataFrames (aka add them together), but now we want to focus on the `merge()` method.

<figure>
	<a href="https://kentonrambsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Post45-1024x429.jpg">
		<img src="https://kentonrambsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Post45-1024x429.jpg" alt="Post45" class="image-popup">
	</a>
</figure>

First though we need another dataset to merge with our `novels_df`. We could take a look at sites like Kaggle to find more datasets, or more specific ones like the *Post45 Data Collective*, which "peer reviews and houses literary and cultural data from 1945 to the present" [https://data.post45.org/](https://data.post45.org/).

<figure>
	<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post45_data.png">
		<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post45_data.png" alt="Post45" class="image-popup">
	</a>
</figure>

While there's a number of relevant datasets in the *Post45 Data Collective*, we could use the one about *New York Times* Hardcover Fiction Bestsellers, 1931â€“2020, created by Jordan Pruett [https://data.post45.org/nyt-fiction-bestsellers-data/](https://data.post45.org/nyt-fiction-bestsellers-data/). According to the documentation, this dataset contains the following:

> The New York Times Hardcover Fiction Bestsellers (1931â€“2020) contains three related datasets. The first dataset provides a tabular representation of the hardcover fiction bestseller list of The New York Times every week between 1931 and 2020. The second dataset provides title-level data for every unique title that appeared on the hardcover fiction bestseller list during this time period. The third dataset provides HathiTrust Digital Library identifiers for every unique title that appeared on the hardcover fiction bestseller list and that also has a corresponding volume in the HathiTrust Digital Library.

> Previous research using similar data has been limited to partial segments of the list, such as the top 200 longest-running bestsellers since a certain date (Piper and Portelance, 2016) or bestsellers from only particular years (Sorenson, 2007). By contrast, this dataset covers the full list since its inception in 1931, along with each reported workâ€™s title, author(s), date of appearance, and rank.

Getting this additional dataset will allow us to explore the relationship between the *New York Times* bestsellers and the top 500 novels as recorded by OCLC.

<figure>
	<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/nyt_data.png">
		<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/nyt_data.png" alt="NYT Data" class="image-popup">
	</a>
</figure>

If we click on the `Explore/download data` for the first dataset, we see a new page that has the remote url for the dataset: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecds/post45-datasets/main/nyt_full.tsv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecds/post45-datasets/main/nyt_full.tsv). 

Notice the `raw.githubusercontent.com` in the URL. This tells us that this is a raw file from a GitHub repository, which is a common way to share datasets, and we can even see the actual file here [https://github.com/Post45-Data-Collective/data/tree/main/nyt_hardcover_fiction_bestsellers](https://github.com/Post45-Data-Collective/data/tree/main/nyt_hardcover_fiction_bestsellers).

We can copy that and load it into a new DataFrame.

```python
nyt_bestsellers_df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecds/post45-datasets/main/nyt_full.tsv")
```

However, we will likely see the following error in our Notebook:

```bash
ParserError: Error tokenizing data. C error: Expected 1 fields in line 163, saw 3
```

This error is telling us that there is an issue with the way the data is formatted. In this case, the dataset is actually a tab-separated values (TSV) file, which means that we need to specify the `sep` parameter when we read it in.

```python
nyt_bestsellers_df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecds/post45-datasets/main/nyt_full.tsv", sep="\t")
```

Encoding errors are common when working with data, especially data that was produced by others. The reason for this is that different operating systems and software use different character encodings to represent text. When we save a file, it is encoded in a specific way, and when we open it, we need to know how it was encoded in order to read it correctly.

<figure>
    <a href="https://media.emailonacid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/content_type_example.jpeg">
    <img src="https://media.emailonacid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/content_type_example.jpeg" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

`ISO-8859-1` and `utf-8` are both character encodings used to represent text in computers. `ISO-8859-1`, also known as `Latin-1`, is a single-byte encoding that can represent the first 256 Unicode characters but only covers Western European languages. On the other hand, `utf-8` is far more popular because it is a variable-width character encoding that can encode all possible Unicode characters.

In our case, we didn't need to specify the encoding, but if we did, we could have added the `encoding` parameter to our `read_csv()` method.

```python
nyt_bestsellers_df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecds/post45-datasets/main/nyt_full.tsv", sep="\t", encoding='utf-8')
```

Now that we have both datasets loaded, we can start to explore them. Let's take a look at the columns in the `nyt_bestsellers_df` DataFrame.

```python
nyt_bestsellers_df.info()
```

Which gives us the following output:

```bash
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 60386 entries, 0 to 60385
Data columns (total 6 columns):
 #   Column    Non-Null Count  Dtype 
---  ------    --------------  ----- 
 0   year      60386 non-null  int64 
 1   week      60386 non-null  object
 2   rank      60386 non-null  int64 
 3   title_id  60386 non-null  int64 
 4   title     60386 non-null  object
 5   author    60376 non-null  object
dtypes: int64(3), object(3)
memory usage: 2.8+ MB
```

We can see that this dataset has 60386 rows and 6 columns. The columns are `year`, `week`, `rank`, `title_id`, `title`, and `author`. We can also see that the `author` column has ten missing values, but that overall, this dataset has very few null values and is much larger than the `novels_df` DataFrame.

Now we can start to merge the two DataFrames together. We've mentioned merging datasets a bit when we discussed joining data in class and SQL, but now we want to dig into details. Often times when we're working with datasets, we will have our data split into multiple `csv` files or have differently shaped datasets (i.e. some of them will have more rows or columns than other datasets). Pandas has built in functionality that let's us merge together DataFrames so that we can perform analysis on the combined dataset, which you can read about in the very extensive documentation here [https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/merging.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/merging.html).

While this documentation shows a number of ways to combined datasets (`concat` let's you combine datasets by stacking them on top of each other, `join` let's you combine datasets by joining them on a common index, and `merge` let's you combine datasets by joining them on a common column), we will focus on the `merge` method.

<figure>
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/merge_syntax.png">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/merge_syntax.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

If we take a look at the documentation, we see the syntax above, which shows us that in Pandas we use the `merge()` function to combine datasets. The `merge()` function takes in a number of parameters, but the most important ones are `left`, `right`, `how`, and `on`. The `left` and `right` parameters are the DataFrames we want to merge, the `how` parameter is the type of join we want to undertake, and the `on` parameter is the column we want to join the DataFrames on.

We can also see an example of how this works in the figure below.

<figure>
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/merge_example.png">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/merge_example.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

You'll notice that we can see a description of the types of `how` parameters we can use. These are the same types of joins that we discussed in class and in SQL. The `how` parameter can be set to `left`, `right`, `outer`, or `inner`. The `left` join will return all the rows from the left DataFrame and the matching rows from the right DataFrame. The `right` join will return all the rows from the right DataFrame and the matching rows from the left DataFrame. The `outer` join will return all the rows from the left DataFrame and the right DataFrame. The `inner` join will return only the rows that match in both DataFrames.

<figure>
    <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*9eH1_7VbTZPZd9jBiGIyNA.png">
    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*9eH1_7VbTZPZd9jBiGIyNA.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

Now that we are starting to understand this logic, we can consider how we might merge our datasets. First, we can double check the columns in our `novels_df` and `nyt_bestsellers_df` DataFrames to see if there are any common columns we can use to merge them.

```python
novels_df.columns, nyt_bestsellers_df.columns
```

This gives us the following output:

```bash
(Index(['top_500_rank', 'title', 'author', 'pub_year', 'orig_lang', 'genre',
        'author_birth', 'author_death', 'author_gender', 'author_primary_lang',
        'author_nationality', 'author_field_of_activity', 'author_occupation',
        'oclc_holdings', 'oclc_eholdings', 'oclc_total_editions',
        'oclc_holdings_rank', 'oclc_editions_rank', 'gr_avg_rating',
        'gr_num_ratings', 'gr_num_reviews', 'gr_avg_rating_rank',
        'gr_num_ratings_rank', 'oclc_owi', 'author_viaf', 'gr_url', 'wiki_url',
        'pg_eng_url', 'pg_orig_url'],
       dtype='object'),
 Index(['year', 'week', 'rank', 'title_id', 'title', 'author'], dtype='object'))
```

We could eyeball the likely similar columns, but we can also use the `intersection()` method to find the common columns.

```python
set(novels_df.columns).intersection(set(nyt_bestsellers_df.columns))
```

This gives us the following output:

```bash
{'author', 'title'}
```

`intersection()` is a built-in Python method that returns the common elements between two sets. `set()` is another built-in Python method that creates a `set object`, which is an unordered collection of unique elements (somewhat similar to `tuples`). Sets can be very useful when you want to find the **unique** elements in a list. In this case, we are using `set()` to convert the column names of both DataFrames into sets, and then using `intersection()` to find the common columns.

Now that we know we have two columns we can use to merge the DataFrames, we can start to do that. Let's say we want to do a left join, which will return all the rows from the `novels_df` DataFrame and the matching rows from the `nyt_bestsellers_df` DataFrame.

```python
merged_df = novels_df.merge(nyt_bestsellers_df, how='left', on=['author', 'title'])
```

While this code should work, you'll notice if you print out the `merged_df` DataFrame that while there are new columns from the `nyt_bestsellers_df` in our `merged_df` there only `NaN` values in those columns. Why is that?

<figure>
	<a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExaGZlbnI4M3d1dWo2bndkeWN4MTRjN2xrZWl2NWdxdjRnaDkwODhsZyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/xUPGcjUQcWclgK94ti/giphy.gif">

</figure>

To figure out where we went wrong, we need to check the values in the `author` and `title` columns in both DataFrames, and specifically see if any of them exist in both DataFrames. We can do this by using the `isin()` and `nunique()` method to get the unique values in each column.

```python
shared_authors = novels_df[novels_df['author'].isin(nyt_bestsellers_df['author'])]['author'].nunique()
shared_titles = novels_df[novels_df['title'].isin(nyt_bestsellers_df['title'])]['title'].nunique()

print(f"Number of shared authors: {shared_authors}")
print(f"Number of shared titles: {shared_titles}")
```

This prints out the following:

```bash
Number of shared authors: 122
Number of shared titles: 0
```

This tells us that while there are 122 shared authors, there are no shared titles. This is surprising, so let's investigate further. There's a number of ways we could solve this mystery, but let's first try seeing what the most prolific authors are in both datasets.

```python
novels_df[novels_df['author'].isin(nyt_bestsellers_df['author'])]['author'].value_counts().head(5)
```

This gives us the following output:

```bash
John Grisham          19
John Steinbeck         8
Nicholas Sparks        7
Stephen King           7
Dan Brown              5
Name: author, dtype: int64
```

And now let's do the same for the `nyt_bestsellers_df` DataFrame.

```python
nyt_bestsellers_df[nyt_bestsellers_df['author'].isin(novels_df['author'])]['author'].value_counts()
```

This gives us the following output:

```bash
Stephen King               892
John Grisham               789
David Baldacci             396
Nicholas Sparks            390
Herman Wouk                375
```

We can see that across both datasets `Stephen King` and `John Grisham` are the most prolific authors, but we still don't know why there are no shared titles. Let's try filtering for the titles in the `novels_df` and `nyt_bestsellers_df` DataFrames.

```python
novel_titles = novels_df[novels_df.author == "Stephen King"].title.unique()
nyt_titles = nyt_bestsellers_df[nyt_bestsellers_df.author == "Stephen King"].title.unique()

print(f"Stephen King's novels: {novel_titles}")
print(f"Stephen King's NYT bestsellers: {nyt_titles}")
```

This gives us the following output:

```bash
Stephen King's novels: ['The Stand' 'It' 'The Shining' 'Misery' 'Carrie' 'The Gunslinger'
 'Dreamcatcher']
Stephen King's NYT bestsellers: ['THE SHINING' 'THE STAND' 'THE DEAD ZONE' 'FIRESTARTER' 'CUJO'
 'DIFFERENT SEASONS' 'CHRISTINE' 'PET SEMATARY' 'SKELETON CREW'
 'THE BACHMAN BOOKS' 'IT' 'THE EYES OF THE DRAGON' 'MISERY'
 'THE TOMMYKNOCKERS' 'THE DARK HALF' 'FOUR PAST MIDNIGHT' 'NEEDFUL THINGS'
 "GERALD'S GAME" 'DOLORES CLAIBORNE' 'NIGHTMARES & DREAMSCAPES' 'INSOMNIA'
 'ROSE MADDER' 'DESPERATION' 'WIZARD AND GLASS' 'BAG OF BONES'
 'THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON' 'HEARTS IN ATLANTIS' 'DREAMCATCHER'
 "EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL" 'FROM A BUICK 8' 'THE DARK TOWER: Volumes 1-5'
 'SONG OF SUSANNAH' 'THE DARK TOWER' 'CELL' 'ELL' "LISEY'S STORY"
 'LISEYâ€™S STORY' 'DUMA KEY' 'JUST AFTER SUNSET' 'UNDER THE DOME'
 'BLOCKADE BILLY' 'FULL DARK, NO STARS' '11/22/63'
 'THE WIND THROUGH THE KEYHOLE' 'DOCTOR SLEEP' 'MR. MERCEDES' 'REVIVAL'
 'FINDERS KEEPERS' 'THE BAZAAR OF BAD DREAMS' 'END OF WATCH'
 'THE OUTSIDER' 'ELEVATION' 'THE INSTITUTE' 'IF IT BLEEDS']
```

We can see that King has had many bestsellers and that there is overlap in the titles. However, the titles in the `nyt_bestsellers_df` DataFrame are all uppercase, while the titles in the `novels_df` DataFrame are capitalized. This is likely the reason why there are no shared titles in the two DataFrames.

We could fix this a number of ways, but let's just convert the titles in the `nyt_bestsellers_df` DataFrame to capitalize the first letter of each word.

```python
nyt_bestsellers_df = nyt_bestsellers_df.rename(columns={'title': 'nyt_title'})
nyt_bestsellers_df['title'] = nyt_bestsellers_df['nyt_title'].str.capitalize()
```

Notice rather than modifying the original column, we renamed the original column from `title` to `nyt_title` and then created a new column called `title` that has the capitalized titles. This way we can still reference the original column if we need to and we haven't lost any data, but we can also now merge the two DataFrames.

First, if we rerun our shared titles check, we should see that there are now some shared titles.

```python
shared_titles = novels_df[novels_df['title'].isin(nyt_bestsellers_df['title'])]['title'].nunique()
print(f"Number of shared titles: {shared_titles}")
```

We now should see that there are `12` shared titles. Now we can try merging the two DataFrames again. One of the things we need to decide is how we want to merge the two DataFrames. Since we want to keep all the novels in the `novels_df` DataFrame, we will do a left join. However, we could also experiment with an inner and outer joins to see how many rows we would get back.

```python
inner_merged_df = novels_df.merge(nyt_bestsellers_df, how='inner', on=['author', 'title'])
outer_merged_df = novels_df.merge(nyt_bestsellers_df, how='outer', on=['author', 'title'])
left_merged_df = novels_df.merge(nyt_bestsellers_df, how='left', on=['author', 'title'])
print(f"Inner merge length: {len(inner_merged_df)}")
print(f"Outer merge length: {len(outer_merged_df)}")
print(f"Left merge length: {len(left_merged_df)}")
```

This should give us the following output:

```bash
Inner merge length: 231
Outer merge length: 60876
Left merge length: 721
```

We can see that how we merge the DataFrames can have a significant impact on the number of rows we get back. In this case, we can see that the left merge gives us 721 rows, which is the number of novels we had in the original `novels_df` DataFrame plus the 12 shared titles. The inner merge gives us 231 rows, which is the number of novels that are in both DataFrames, and the outer merge gives us 60876 rows, which is the total number of rows in both DataFrames. Depending on our research questions, we might want the outer merge to see all the data and rankings between the datasets, or the inner merge to focus on the novels that are in both datasets. For the remainder of this lesson, we'll use the left merge since we want the full dataset of novels, and then the additional information from the bestsellers to augment our analysis.

```python
combined_novels_nyt_df = novels_df.merge(nyt_bestsellers_df, how='left', on=['author', 'title'])
```

## EDA With Pandas

Since we are working with datasets with significant documentation, we have a fairly good sense of what is in these datasets. However, often you will be working with datasets that are less documented, and so it is important to understand how to explore them. This process is often called *Exploratory Data Analysis*.

<figure>

    </a>
    <figcaption>From ZoÃ« Wilkinson SaldaÃ±a "Sentiment Analysis for Exploratory Data Analysis" <a href="https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sentiment-analysis">https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sentiment-analysis</a></figcaption>
</figure>

You've likely heard this term before, but let's historically contextualize this idea. The term *Exploratory Data Analysis* (EDA) was popularized by John W. Tukey, one of the most famous statisticians and mathematicians of the 20th century. Tukey was one of the first to formally define the concept of data analysis in 1962 paper titled "The Future of Data Analysis."

<figure>
	<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/tukey_future_data_analysis.png">
	<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/tukey_future_data_analysis.png" class="image-popup">
	</a>
</figure>

In the paper, Tukey starts the paper, writing:

> For a long time I have thought I was a statistician, interested in inferences from the particular to the general. But as I have watched mathematical statistics evolve, I have had cause to wonder and to doubt. [...] All in all, I have come to feel that my central interest is in *data analysis*, which I take to include, among other things: procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data.

Such a framing might seem straightforward today in the age of Data Science, but at the time it was a radical shift for how we thought about working with data. You'll notice in that image from the paper, which you can download [here](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aoms/1177704711) if you're curious, that Tukey was affiliated with Princeton University and Bell Telephone Laboratories when he published the paper. Both of these were key institutions in the development of modern computing and statistics. For example, if you've heard of Alan Turing or Claude Shannon, they were also affiliated with Bell Labs, and Tukey worked with both of them, especially during World War II.

<figure>

	</a>
</figure>

This infographic gives a sense of some of the inventions and discoveries that happened at Bell Labs, which was one of the most important research and development organizations in the 20th century. In the case of Tukey, he's credited not just with exploratory data analysis but also coining both the terms `bit`, a portmanteau of binary digit, and `software` in 1958, and he was also crucial in popularizing the fourier transform for digital signal processing, which we learned about with the Syuzhet package.

Tukey was a very eclectic scholar, and worked on everything from developing better sampling methods after reviewing the [Kinsey report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Reports), which was a landmark study of human sexuality released in two books in 1948 and 1953, to developing better methods for election polling. He collected and published his central thoughts on EDA in his 1977 book *Exploratory Data Analysis*, where he argued that EDA could help suggest hypotheses that could be then tested statistically.

<figure>
    <a href="https://devopedia.org/images/article/75/3879.1525341742.jpg">
    <img src="https://devopedia.org/images/article/75/3879.1525341742.jpg" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

Such a shift might again seem obvious today, but at the time most statisticians focused on "confirmatory data analysis", that is testing a hypothesis statistically rather than exploring the data first to see what might be possible. Tukey's innovation helped set the groundwork for a lot of modern data science, where we tend to be closer to detectives trying to look for clues rather than approaching data with firm assumptions about what it represents.

While there are not firm principles for EDA, Tukey argued that it should cover the following concepts:

- understanding the dataâ€™s underlying structure and extracting important variables
- detecting outliers and anomalies
- and testing underlying assumptions through visualizations, statistics, and other methods, without initially focusing on formal modeling or hypothesis testing. This approach differs with traditional hypothesis-driven analyses, promoting a more flexible and intuitive investigation into the data.

With Pandas we can start to implement these with code:

1. We want to explore the data, so we could use `head()`, `tail()`, or `sample()` methods to display a subset of the dataset. We could also use `.shape` or `.dtypes` to see shaped of the DataFrame and the data types of each column.

2. Next we might use the `describe()` method to output a summary of our dataset. According to the documentation for this method, it provides "descriptive statistics include those that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of a datasetâ€™s distribution, excluding NaN values." [(Read the docs here)](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html).

3. After getting this bird's eye view of the distribution of the data, we could use `sort_values()` or `nsmallest()` / `nlargest()` to either organize the dataset or return the rows with maximum or minimum of values in a certain column.

4. We can use the `isna()` to see what values might be missing in the dataset. Remember that `isna()` can be run on either individual columns or the entire DataFrame, and that you can chain it with other methods `any()` to check if there are *any* null values in the data.

5. Finally we would use the `plot()` method to do some initial graphing of the trends in our data to fully help explore its distribution and potential correlations.

So in our case, we might first use `.dtypes` on our `combined_novels_nyt_df` to see what types of data we have.

```python
combined_novels_nyt_df.dtypes
```

Then we might use the `describe()` method to output a summary of our dataset.

```python
combined_novels_nyt_df.describe()
```

We could also use the `sort_values()` method to organize the dataset by the `year` or `pub_year` column.

```python
combined_novels_nyt_df.sort_values('year')
```

We could also use the `isna()` method to see what values might be missing in the dataset.

```python
combined_novels_nyt_df.isna().any()
```

Now that we have a sense of the distribution of our data, we can start to visualize it to see if we can answer our questions.

Like many of the methods above, `plot` is built into Pandas and is a wrapper around the `matplotlib` library [https://matplotlib.org/](https://matplotlib.org/), one of the most popular Python libraries for data visualization. This means that we can use the `plot()` method to create a variety of different plots. We can read more about the `plot()` method in the Pandas documentation here [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html), where it lists the kinds of plots we can create:

- â€˜lineâ€™ : line plot (default)
- â€˜barâ€™ : vertical bar plot
- â€˜barhâ€™ : horizontal bar plot
- â€˜histâ€™ : histogram
- â€˜boxâ€™ : boxplot
- â€˜kdeâ€™ : Kernel Density Estimation plot
- â€˜densityâ€™ : same as â€˜kdeâ€™
- â€˜areaâ€™ : area plot
- â€˜pieâ€™ : pie plot
- â€˜scatterâ€™ : scatter plot (DataFrame only)
- â€˜hexbinâ€™ : hexbin plot (DataFrame only)

Pandas also has a robust User Guide on how to plot here [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html).

From these examples we can see that the `plot` syntax requires specifying the type of graph we want to create, and then what we want on the x and y axis. Currently, we have the following columns in our DataFrame:

```bash
'top_500_rank', 'title', 'author', 'pub_year', 'orig_lang', 'genre',
 'author_birth', 'author_death', 'author_gender', 'author_primary_lang',
 'author_nationality', 'author_field_of_activity', 'author_occupation',
 'oclc_holdings', 'oclc_eholdings', 'oclc_total_editions',
 'oclc_holdings_rank', 'oclc_editions_rank', 'gr_avg_rating',
 'gr_num_ratings', 'gr_num_reviews', 'gr_avg_rating_rank',
 'gr_num_ratings_rank', 'oclc_owi', 'author_viaf', 'gr_url', 'wiki_url',
 'pg_eng_url', 'pg_orig_url', 'year', 'week', 'rank', 'title_id',
 'nyt_title'
```

So we have a number of potential comparisons and explorations we could undertake. For example, if we wanted to create a scatter plot looking at the relationship between the `pub_year` and `top_500_rank` columns, we could do the following:

```python
combined_novels_nyt_df.plot(kind='scatter', x='pub_year', y='top_500_rank')
```

We should see the following graph:

<figure>
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/toprank_year_novels.png">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/toprank_year_novels.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

We could also use a `groupby()` to explore the relationship between `genre` and the average `top_500_rank` for each genre, and then plot that directly:

```python
combined_novels_nyt_df.groupby('genre')['top_500_rank'].mean().plot(kind='bar')
```

Which gives us the following output:

<figure>
	<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/genre_mean.png">
	<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/genre_mean.png" class="image-popup">
	</a>
</figure>

Now that we are starting to see how we can visualize our data, we need to start thinking more deeply about what questions might be of interest to us and how the shape of this data influences how we can answer these questions.

### "Cleaning" Data With Pandas

As we've discussed previously, `cleaning` data is core part of working with data but also one that tends to get overlooked or rarely foregrounded, even though it is extremely important for any interpretation. In our current example, we've already started to clean our data by merging the DataFrames together and transforming the data to make it more amenable to analysis. We might also want to subset the data, since as we can see above not every book has a genre:

```python
subset_combined_novels_nyt_df = combined_novels_nyt_df[combined_novels_nyt_df.genre.notna()]
```

As we discussed in class, a lot of what motivates this "cleaning", whether that means normalizing distributions, removing null values, and even transforming some of the data to standardize it, is the concept of **GIGO**.

<figure>
    <a href="https://www.harrised.com/150/images/gigo.jpeg">
    <img src="https://www.harrised.com/150/images/gigo.jpeg" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

GIGO stands for "Garbage In, Garbage Out" and the term has been used for decades in computing to refer to when data entry errors would produce faulty results. Rob Stenson has a great  post exploring the history of the term all the way back to Charles Babbage, one of the first inventors of the computer, [https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/is-this-the-first-time-anyone-printed-garbage-in-garbage-out](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/is-this-the-first-time-anyone-printed-garbage-in-garbage-out).

GIGO is important because it essentially means that the quality of your data analysis is always dependent on the quality of your data.

However, for as much as we want to prioritize quality, what are some of the downsides or tradeoffs of cleaning data? Some potential considerations include:

- losing the specificity of the original data (especially a danger for historic data but also for data collected by certain institutions)
- privileging computational power over data quality or accuracy
- releasing datasets publicly without documenting these changes

This list is by no means exhaustive! But number one thing to remember with datasets is that **the act of collecting data is in of itself an interpretation**. And so cleaning data adds another layer of interpretation (sometimes many layers) to the dataset, which is why its crucial to keep a record of how you transform your data.

It is also important to realize that even with cleaning you will never have a *perfect* dataset and to remember that this is often an *iterative process* and not a one time thing. You will likely need to re-transform your data many times depending on your methods.

One best practice is to save multiple versions of your dataset as `csv` files, so that you don't either overwrite your original data or have to rerun previous transformations. Remember that with Pandas we can read and write `csv` files using `pd.read_csv()` and `{name of your dataframe}.to_csv()`.

In addition to thinking about our choices, it is also important to think about the types of data we are working with.

<figure>
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/data_types.png">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/data_types.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

This graph outlines the main types of data you might encounter, which largely breaks down between qualitative (categorical) or quantitative (numerical). Now these data types somewhat overlap with our `.dtypes` in Pandas, but they also go beyond. For example, what in our dataset might be `Nominal` versus `Ordinal`, or `Discrete` versus `Continuous`? To help answer this question, we are going to explore data visualization more in depth with the Python library `Altair`.

## Data Visualization With Altair

Up to now we've been using Pandas built in `plot` methods to display our data. While this is helpful for quick analyses, you'll likely want more options for both how you visualize the data and interact with it.

</figure>

As you can see in these graphics, in Python, there are a number of visualization libraries, including `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Plotly` that have extensive communities and documentation.

</figure>

Today we're going to focus on [Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html), which is a Python library built on top of Vega and Vega-Lite - two visualization libraries for JavaScript. Previously, this library was known as just `Altair` so for brevity in this lesson we will refer to it as such. The library was started in 2016 by Jake VanderPlas and has since grown to be one of the most popular libraries for data visualization in Python.

*Let's install Altair*

Remember to activate your virtual environment!

```sh
pip install "altair[all]"
```

Notice that this time when installing we have a slightly new syntax: `[all]`. This syntax just means that we will be installing all of Altair's dependencies **and** optional dependencies, which includes things like the `vega_datasets` package.

*Now let's try it out in our Jupyter Notebook*

```python
import altair as alt
```

Because we are using Altair in a Jupyter Notebook we also need to add a few settings (you read more about this here [https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/display_frontends.html#](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/display_frontends.html#)).

If you are running your Notebook in the browser, you can run the following after you import Altair (more info here [https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/display_frontends.html#displaying-in-jupyter-notebook](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/display_frontends.html#displaying-in-jupyter-notebook)):

```python
# Optional in Jupyter Notebook: requires an up-to-date vega nbextension.
alt.renderers.enable('notebook')
```

If you are running it in VS Code, you can run the following (more info here [https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/display_frontends.html#displaying-in-vscode](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/display_frontends.html#displaying-in-vscode)):

```python
# Optional in VS Code
alt.renderers.enable('mimetype')
```

Now we can try out Altair with one of the built-in datasets

```python
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

source = data.cars()

alt.Chart(source).mark_circle(size=60).encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Origin',
    tooltip=['Name', 'Origin', 'Horsepower', 'Miles_per_Gallon']
)
```

You should now see the following graph:

<figure>
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/altair_chart.png" >
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/altair_chart.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

If you don't see the graph and you're running your Jupyter notebook in the browser, you might need to set the kernel of your notebook [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47295871/is-there-a-way-to-use-pipenv-with-jupyter-notebook](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47295871/is-there-a-way-to-use-pipenv-with-jupyter-notebook) or set the vega extension with following:

```sh
jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --py vega
```

*So let's breakdown what we're doing here*

First we are specifying a new [`Chart` class](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/generated/toplevel/altair.Chart.html#altair.Chart). In Altair, there are a number of Chart types that we'll delve into later but it essentially is the basic class we'll be working with (more information here [https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/api.html#top-level-objects](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/api.html#top-level-objects)).

<figure>
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/top_level_charts.png" >
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/top_level_charts.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

We pass our data to the `Chart` and then specify the type of `mark` we are using (in our case we are using `mark_point()` to make points). In Altair, we can use all types of marks to represent our data <https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/marks.html>.

<figure>
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mark_types.png" >
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mark_types.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

Finally we are calling encoding to specify what variable we want to represent on the `x` and `y` axis, as well as through the `color` encoding. Altair has many fields for encoding [https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/encoding.html](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/encoding.html)

<figure>
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/encodings.png" >
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/encodings.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

<figure>
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/encoding_data_types.png" >
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/encoding_data_types.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

Now that we understand a bit of Altair's syntax, let's try to recreated our `genre` by average `top_500_rank` plot that we made previously. To do this, we don't have to do `groupby`, instead Altair can handle most of the logic for us:

```python
alt.Chart(combined_novels_nyt_df).mark_bar().encode(
	x="genre:N",
	y="mean(top_500_rank):Q",
)
```

Which gives us the following output:

<figure>
	<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/altair_genre_top500.png">
	<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/altair_genre_top500.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

We can see that some of the syntax is similar to the initial example. We are passing in our DataFrame to the `Chart` class, calling the `mark_bar` method, and then encoding the `x` and `y` axis. But some of this syntax is also new.

For instance, we are specifying the `encodings` using the `N` for nominal and `Q` for quantitative. We are also using an `aggregate` function to calculate the `mean`. You can read more about aggregation here [https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/transform/aggregate.html](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/transform/aggregate.html), but generally Altair has the following aggregations built-in:

| Aggregation Operation | Description | Syntax |

While it's great we can recreate this plot, what's the point exactly? After all we can do this in `plot` without having to use another library. 

The value of using a library like Altair is that it is built to implement the idea of a `Grammar of Graphics`.

*The Grammar of Graphics* is both a concept and book published in 1999 by Leland Wilkinson, a statistician and computer scientist Wilkinson developed this idea from his experience in developing SYSTAT, a statistical software package he founded in 1983, where he saw the need for a more structured and flexible framework for data visualization.

Wilkinsonâ€™s grammar aimed to define a set of rules or components that could describe any kind of statistical graphic, from simple bar charts to complex scatter plots and heatmaps. By breaking down graphics into fundamental elements (like data, geometries, and scales), his grammar provides a way to think of visualizations as composable and modularâ€”allowing users to understand and generate diverse charts based on clear principles. Wilkinsonâ€™s ideas have influenced many modern visualization tools and libraries like `ggplot2` in R, as well as Altair.

In the Grammar of Graphics, every visualization is built using the following core components:

1. Data: The dataset that you want to visualize.
2. Mappings: How the data variables map to visual properties like axes, colors, or sizes.
3. Geometries (Marks): The basic shapes used to represent the data, such as points, lines, bars, etc.
4. Statistical transformations: Aggregations or transformations applied to the data, such as grouping, counting, or averaging.
5. Scales: How data values are translated into visual values, like positioning on the x- or y-axis.
6. Coordinates: The coordinate system used, such as Cartesian or polar coordinates.
7. Faceting: How the data is split into different panels or sections to show comparisons.

Altair is built around these principles, making it easier to create clear and interpretable visualizations by specifying each component in your code. This approach is not only flexible but also emphasizes transparency, helping you understand how your data is represented visually. Itâ€™s also more extensible, allowing for more complex and interactive visualizations, such as linked plots or selections, which would be difficult to achieve with simpler plotting libraries.

By embracing the Grammar of Graphics, Altair enables you to think more abstractly about the relationship between data and visualization, offering a consistent, rule-based system to produce a wide variety of visual outputs.

Let's try out some of Altair's more advanced functionality to see how it implements this Grammar of Graphics.

For example, we could rather than looking at the relationship between `genre` and average `top 500 rank`, instead look at the relationship between book titles, genre, and that rank with the following code:

```python
alt.Chart(combined_novels_nyt_df).mark_bar().encode(
	x="genre:N",
	y="count():Q",
	color="top_500_rank:Q",
	tooltip=["genre:N", "count():Q", "top_500_rank:Q", "title"]
)
```

Which gives us the following chart:

<figure>
	<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/interactive_genre.png">
	<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/interactive_genre.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

Here we are using two new encodings: `color` and `tooltip`. We could also add a title and even change the color scheme:

```python
alt.Chart(combined_novels_nyt_df).mark_bar().encode(
	x="genre:N",
	y="count():Q",
	color=alt.Color("top_500_rank:Q", scale=alt.Scale(scheme="viridis")),
	tooltip=["genre:N", "count():Q", "top_500_rank:Q", "title"]
).properties(
	title="Top 500 Novels by Genre",
	width=600,
	height=400
)
```

Which produces the following chart:

<figure>
	<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/proper_altair.png">
	<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/proper_altair.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

We could also see these patterns over time. Altair is great at visualizing dates, however, you'll notice our primary date column, `pub_year` only has the year in it. If we try to use it in Altair as is, we get the following graph:

```python
alt.Chart(combined_novels_nyt_df).mark_bar().encode(
	x="pub_year:T",
	y="count():Q",
	color="genre:N"
)
```

<figure>
	<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/date_broken_altair.png">
	<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/date_broken_altair.png" class="image-popup">
    </a>
</figure>

To get this graph working correctly, we need a column that is formatted as `datetime` in Pandas. To do this, there's a number of solutions but one of the easiest is to just create a new column called `pub_date` and use the Pandas `to_datetime()` functionality to cast `pub_year` into a `datetime` format.

```python
combined_novels_nyt_df['pub_date'] = pd.to_datetime(combined_novels_nyt_df['pub_year'].astype(str) + '-01-01', errors='coerce')
```

Now we can recreate our graph:

```python
selection = alt.selection_point(fields=['genre'], bind='legend')

alt.Chart(merged_df).mark_bar().encode(
	x="pub_date:T",
	y="count():Q",
	color="genre:N",
	tooltip=["genre:N", "count():Q"],
	opacity=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(1), alt.value(0.2))
).add_params(selection).properties(
	title="Top 500 Novels by Genre Over Time",
	width=800,
	height=400
)
```

And here is a live version of it:

<div id="top_novels"></div>

You'll notice our syntax is again a bit more complex. You can read about how Altair enables interactivity in the documentation here [https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/interactions.html](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/interactions.html), but to summarize, we've now added the ability not just to have a tooltip but also to visually select our categories in the legend.

As we are starting to see Altair is a very powerful library. We will continue to explore its functionality in the coming weeks, but would highly encourage you to take a look at the example visualizations on the Altair website [https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html) and the documentation [https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html).

## Exploring and Visualizing Culture Homework

Now that you have begun to grasp the fundamentals of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Altair, this assignment will guide you through a deeper exploration of the Goodreads Top Ranked Novels and *New York Times* Bestseller datasets. Your task is not only to create visualizations but also to engage critically with the data, identifying patterns, gaps, and potential biases that can inform future research.

In the documentation for the Top Novels dataset, there is a section on `Discussion & Activities` [https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/posts/top-500-novels/top-500-novels.html?tab=discussion-%26-activities](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/posts/top-500-novels/top-500-novels.html?tab=discussion-%26-activities) and specifically a link to a `Google Colab` notebook exploring bias in the metadata of this dataset, available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fxEae0BmUmipDQC2qvqGvG11fIAITZ_K?usp=sharing). For this assignment, I want you to build from both our in-class explorations and this existing Colab notebook. You can reuse code from both, but the overall goal is to start implementing your knowledge of EDA to consider potential future research directions with these datasets.

Begin by creating a new Jupyter Notebook within your `is310-coding-assignments` repository, specifically in the `pandas-eda` folder. As you start this analysis, think carefully about the title of your notebook. The title should reflect the main themes you identify through your EDA, and it should be written in CamelCase (e.g., `GenderTrendsInTopNovels` or `RatingBiasAcrossGenres`). Crafting a meaningful title is an opportunity to synthesize the focus of your work from the start.

You can organize your notebook in any way that makes sense to you, but you should have a rationale and **clearly** label sections using Markdown headers. You should also use `Altair` for all your EDA visualizations. There is no set number of graphs that you must create, but part of it is imagine that you are creating this notebook for someone new to these datasets, so you should consider what would be helpful to explain or include. You also need to consider what you will not analyze, since too much data analysis can be confusing and unhelpful. You should be sure to also include text interpreting your graphs and findings for your reader.

Finally, there are no right or wrong answers for this assignment. Only your sense of what is likely of interest based on your EDA. You could focus on comparisons between the datasets or the intersection of the datasets, and you can explore a number of correlations and relationships, or just a few. So consider this notebook your first attempt at undertaking exploratory data analysis as John Tukey first proposed. 

Once you have completed your assignment, push up your code to GitHub and post a link in this GitHub discussion [https://github.com/CultureAsData-UIUC/is310-fall-2024/discussions/11](https://github.com/CultureAsData-UIUC/is310-fall-2024/discussions/11). Remember to include either remote or local access to the datasets, to avoid pushing up your virtual environment, and to document your folder with a `README.md`. And finally, as always, you are welcome to use AI tools to help you complete this assignment, but again remember you need to understand what the code is doing and you need to be able to explain the overall goals and focus of the notebook.
